### Let download this imge
```
wget http://10.10.81.42/thm.jpg
```
### Its not an image as i examined the first 12 bits of and converted it to a **JPG** format.
```
xxd thm.jpg | head
printf '\xff\xd8\xff\xe0\x00\x10\x4a\x46\x49\x46\x00\x01' | dd conv=notrunc of=thm.jpg bs=1
```
### Let take look at this:
```
http://10.10.81.42/th1s_1s_h1dd3n
```
### Source code i got this ```http://Ip/th1s_1s_h1dd3n/?secret=```


### Doing this manually take a long time let automate this with help of python, I already created secret.py [tap here](https://github.com/Esther7171/THM-Walkthroughs/blob/main/Room/Madness/secret.py) 
```
death@esther:~$ python3 secret.py 
Enter IP:10.10.81.42
Found secret: 73

<h2>Welcome! I have been expecting you!</h2>
