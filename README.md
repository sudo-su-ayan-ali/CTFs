# ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Welcome to my CTF blog! Iâ€™m a cybersecurity professional specializing in offensive security, automation, and ethical hacking. My journey is driven by curiosity and a passion for solving real-world security challenges. I actively participate in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions and bug bounty programs to sharpen my skills and stay ahead in the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape.

## My Methodology

My approach to CTFs and penetration testing is systematic, adaptable, and rooted in best practices. Hereâ€™s a high-level overview of my workflow:

### 1.Â **Enumeration**

- **Active Scanning:**Â Begin with comprehensive network scans (Nmap, Rustscan) to map out the attack surface.
- **Service Analysis:**Â Identify running services, versions, and potential misconfigurations.
- **Content Discovery:**Â Use tools like Gobuster, Dirsearch, and manual exploration to uncover hidden files and directories.

### 2.Â **Vulnerability Identification**

- **Manual & Automated Research:**Â Cross-reference service versions with known vulnerabilities using CVE databases and Exploit-DB.
- **Fuzzing & Testing:**Â Employ fuzzers and custom scripts to probe for weaknesses.

### 3.Â **Exploitation**

- **Custom Exploits:**Â Develop or adapt exploits to gain initial access when necessary.
- **Public Tools:**Â Leverage proven frameworks and tools (Metasploit, Impacket, CrackMapExec) for efficiency.

### 4.Â **Post-Exploitation & Privilege Escalation**

- **Enumeration Scripts:**Â Use tools like LinPEAS, WinPEAS, and manual checks to identify privilege escalation vectors.
- **Persistence & Lateral Movement:**Â Explore ways to maintain access and pivot within the environment.

### 5.Â **Capture the Flag & Documentation**

- **Flag Retrieval:**Â Locate and extract flags, documenting each step for clarity and reproducibility.
- **Knowledge Sharing:**Â Write detailed, step-by-step walkthroughs to help others learn and grow.

## Mindset

I believe in combining technical rigor with creative problem-solving. Every challenge is an opportunity to learn, automate, or build something new. Sharing knowledge is central to my philosophyâ€”my writeups are crafted to be clear, actionable, and educational for the community.
